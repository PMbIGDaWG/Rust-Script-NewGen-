For First Time Users 

Turning the Script On (Step-by-Step)
    
 Make sure the script is active in Logitech G Hub:
•    Open Logitech G Hub.
•    Select your mouse.
•    Go to the “Assignments” tab ➜ Click “Scripting”.
•    Make sure the correct script (the one we made) is loaded and enabled for the Rust profile.
 Toggle the script ON/OFF with the Scroll Lock key:,
•    Press the Scroll Lock key on your keyboard.
•    You should hear a beep (if your keyboard has it), or
•    In the G Hub console log, it’ll say:,
"AK Recoil Script ENABLED"
    
 Use it in-game:
•    Hold Right Mouse Button (RMB) to aim.
•    Hold Left Mouse Button (LMB) to shoot.
•    The script will automatically move your mouse to counter recoil for all 30 bullets.
 Toggle OFF anytime:,
•    Press Scroll Lock again.
•    You’ll see:,
"AK Recoil Script DISABLED"

 Troubleshooting Tips
    •    If nothing happens when you press Scroll Lock, make sure:
    •    G Hub is running.
    •    The script is active for your Rust profile.
    •    The Scroll Lock key is working on your keyboard (some 60% keyboards don’t have it).
    •     If you don’t have Scroll Lock, I can change the toggle key to something else — like a mouse button or F1–F12.

Would you like me to change the toggle key to a mouse button (like Mouse Button 4 or 5)
